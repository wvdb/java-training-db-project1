## Unit Testing

Unit testing:
* don't go for the easy path
* unit tests should be small and should contain little logic
* when a unit test fails, it is easy to understand the reason for the failure
* A single test should not depend on running other tests before it, nor should it be affected by the order of execution of other tests.
* unit testing, integration testing, load testing, stress testing ....
* TDD (test driven development)
* BDD (behavior driven development) -> cucumber : https://cucumber.io/school
